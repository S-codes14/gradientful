## About
This is an effort to give back to the community, by the community. Hopefully this will help you draw inspiration and serve as a resource for picking gradients for your own projects.

&nbsp;

## Contributing
Adding a gradient to the library is super simple. All the gradients are loaded and rendered from a single `gradients.json` file in the root.

To add your gradient, fork this repository, add your gradient colors in the HEX format along with a name to the end of the json file and submit a pull request. Don't forget the commas!

```
[
    {
        …
    },
    {
      "name": "Career",
      "colors": ["#cb202d", "#dc1e28", "#3366cc"]
    }
]
```

*NOTE* - Please keep gradient submissions and bug fixes in separate PRs.

&nbsp;

### Improvements and Bugs
Please feel free to open a new issue [here](https://github.com/S-codes14/gradientful/issues) with your suggestions or any bugs which you may have come across.

&nbsp;

## Data
While there is no official api, all the gradients are present in the `gradients.json` file.
